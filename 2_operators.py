'''Arithamatic Operators'''
# a = 20
# b = 10
# + (sum of int or float)
# - (subtract of int or float)
# * (multiply of int or float)
# ** (power of int or float)
# / (Gives Quotient in float)
# // (Gives Quotient in int also called floor division)
# % (Gives Remainder)
# print('The Addition of', a ,'and', b, 'is', a + b)

'''Logical Operators'''
